## Work in Progress 🏗️

This is my playground, where I test ideas, iterations, implementations and track them for future uses.

Ideally a reference template for project creation for various components such as

- backend services like auth, gateway in micro pattern
- Code example such as services rest, grpc, client integrations, db integration, caching (different strategies)
- yamls for containerized components for dev. env. setup such as compose for dbs, message queue(s), caching
- helm manifests

### Tech Stack in Purview

- Spring Boot for backend
- React + Vite for Frontend
- MySql for persistance
